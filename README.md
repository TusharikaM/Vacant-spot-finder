Find a vacant spot in a library using Amazon Alexa.
This Project was done as a team project for CSCI 8000 Cloud Computing @ UGA along with Dhanashree Joshi and Gibson Foss
Note: Object Detection was done using Tensorflow API using ssd-mobilenet

We built our application in Amazon Alexa developer console. Our skill service resides in aws lambda function which is written in python. We used Amazon's S3 (Simple storage service)- to store our data.
The connection to lambda function with other entities was done via trigger mechanism.
